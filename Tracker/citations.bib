Our Wigner-like surmises are shown to be very accurate when compared to numerics and exact calculations in the large matrix size limit. Quantitative improvements are found through a polynomial expansion. Examples from a quantum many-body lattice model and from zeros of the Riemann zeta function are presented.},

These are the circular orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic ensembles, denoted COE, CUE, and CSE, respectively. For each of these three ensembles and their thinned versions, whereby each eigenvalue is deleted independently with probability , we take up the problem of calculating the first two terms in the scaled large N expansion of the spacing distributions. It is well known that the leading term admits a characterization in terms of both Fredholm determinants and Painlevé transcendents. We show that modifications of these characterizations also remain valid for the next to leading term, and that they provide schemes for high precision numerical computations. In the case of the CUE, there is an application to the analysis of Odlyzko's data set for the Riemann zeros, and in that case, some further statistics are similarly analyzed.},

However, in all these systems there has been one unifying feature: the combination of half-integer spin and time-reversal invariance. Here we provide an alternative mechanism for obtaining GSE statistics that is derived from geometric symmetries of a quantum system which alleviates the need for spin. As an example, we construct a quantum graph with a discrete symmetry given by the quaternion group Q8 and observe GSE statistics within one of its subspectra. We then show how to isolate this subspectrum and construct a quantum graph with a scalar valued wave function and a pure GSE spectrum.},

We report experimental measurements of the diffusion constant on the atomic version of the system and develop a theoretical approach (based on the Floquet theorem) explaining the observations, especially the “sub-Fourier” character of the resonances observed in the vicinity of exact periodicity, i.e. the ability of the system to distinguish two neighboring driving frequencies in a time shorter than the inverse of the difference of the two frequencies.},

  abstract = {We study the kicked rotator in the classically fully chaotic regime using Izrailev's N-dimensional model for various N≤4000, which in the limit N→∞ tends to the quantized kicked rotator. We do treat not only the case K=5, as studied previously, but also many different values of the classical kick parameter 5≤K≤35 and many different values of the quantum parameter k∈[5,60]. We describe the features of dynamical localization of chaotic eigenstates as a paradigm for other both time-periodic and time-independent (autonomous) fully chaotic or/and mixed-type Hamilton systems. We generalize the scaling variable Λ=l∞/N to the case of anomalous diffusion in the classical phase space by deriving the localization length l∞ for the case of generalized classical diffusion. We greatly improve the accuracy and statistical significance of the numerical calculations, giving rise to the following conclusions: (1) The level-spacing distribution of the eigenphases (or quasienergies) is very well described by the Brody distribution, systematically better than by other proposed models, for various Brody exponents βBR. (2) We study the eigenfunctions of the Floquet operator and characterize their localization properties using the information entropy measure, which after normalization is given by βloc in the interval [0,1]. The level repulsion parameters βBR and βloc are almost linearly related, close to the identity line. (3) We show the existence of a scaling law between βloc and the relative localization length Λ, now including the regimes of anomalous diffusion. The above findings are important also for chaotic eigenstates in time-independent systems [Batistić and Robnik, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 43, 215101 (2010); arXiv:1302.7174 (2013)], where the Brody distribution is confirmed to a very high degree of precision for dynamically localized chaotic eigenstates, even in the mixed-type systems (after separation of regular and chaotic eigenstates).},

  abstract = {The relation between the degree of entanglement and time scale of time-irreversible behavior is investigated for classically chaotic quantum coupled kicked rotors by comparing the entanglement entropy (EE) and the lifetime of correspondence with classical decay of correlation, which was recently introduced. Both increase \{\textbackslash it on average\} drastically with a strong correlation when the strength of coupling between the kicked rotors exceeds a certain threshold. The EE shows an anomalously large fluctuation resembling a critical fluctuation around the threshold value of coupling strength where the entanglement sharply increases toward full entanglement. In this regime it can be shown that, although the correlation is hidden, EE and the lifetime of \{\textbackslash it individual eigenfunctions\} also have a positive correlation that can be seen via an another measure.},

The choice of methods pays significant attention to error estimates, stability and convergence issues as well as to the ways to optimize program execution speeds. Many examples are given throughout the chapters, and each chapter is followed by at least a handful of more comprehensive problems which may be dealt with, for example, on a weekly basis in a one- or two-semester course. In these end-of-chapter problems the physics background is pronounced, and the main text preceding them is intended as an introduction or as a later reference. Less stress is given to the explanation of individual algorithms. It is tried to induce in the reader an own independent thinking and a certain amount of scepticism and scrutiny instead of blindly following readily available commercial tools.},
