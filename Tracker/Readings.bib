abstract = {A periodically kicked quantum rotator is related to the Anderson problem of conduction in a one-dimensional disordered lattice. Classically the second model is always chaotic, while the first is chaotic for some values of the parameters. With use of the Anderson-model result that all states are localized, it is concluded that the local quasienergy spectrum of the rotator problem is discrete and that its wave function is almost periodic in time. This allows one to understand on physical grounds some numerical results recently obtained in the context of the rotator problem. {\textcopyright} 1982 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Anderson1958,
abstract = {This paper presents a simple model for such processes as spin diffusion or conduction in the "impurity band." These processes involve transport in a lattice which is in some sense random, and in them diffusion is expected to take place via quantum jumps between localized sites. In this simple model the essential randomness is introduced by requiring the energy to vary randomly from site to site. It is shown that at low enough densities no diffusion at all can take place, and the criteria for transport to occur are given. {\textcopyright} 1958 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Muller2011,
abstract = {In the presence of disorder, classical transport is usually diffusive. This chapter deals with the effect of interference between multiply scattered waves on transport properties. Interference may lead to reduced diffusive transport-this is known as weak localization- or to complete inhibition of transport-which is known as Anderson localization or strong localization. Key parameters are the dimension of the system and the strength of the disorder. After introductory sections on a transfer-matrix description of 1D transport, scaling theory of localization, and key numerical and experimental results, a general microscopic theory of transport in disordered systems is presented, with emphasis on experimental realizations with cold atomic gases. Simple examples are the propagation of light in a disordered medium, for which we show results from a live coherent backscattering expriment, and the propagation of atomic matter waves in an effective disordered potential created by an optical speckle. Finally, the dynamical localization transition of the kicked rotor, as observed with cold atoms, is discussed.},

abstract = {We report a numerical analysis of the Anderson transition in a quantum-chaotic system, the quasiperiodic kicked rotor with three incommensurate frequencies. It is shown that this dynamical system exhibits the same critical phenomena as the truly random 3D Anderson model. By taking proper account of systematic corrections to one-parameter scaling, the universality of the critical exponent is demonstrated. Our result $\nu$=1.59±0.01 is in perfect agreement with the value found for the Anderson model. {\textcopyright} 2009 Europhysics Letters Association.},

This entanglement can be described using the Schmidt decomposition, in which a pair of preferred orthonormal bases can be constructed to emphasize the tight correlations between two quantum subsystems. Examples are given of how the Schmidt basis can be exploited to shed new light on entangled subsystems in quantum optics, paying special attention to two‐mode squeezed states and to atom–field interaction.},
