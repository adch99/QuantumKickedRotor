# Quantum Kicked Rotor

This is a collection of code and presentations prepared by me
while doing a semester project on the quantum kicked rotor.

* This repo was largely made to allow me to work on this project from
  multiple devices, so it may not be as well documented as needed.
* If you want to run these codes, create a `Code/plots/` directory
  otherwise the code will fail.  
* The html files having `profile` in their names are generated by
  `pyinstrument` which is a statistical profiler.
* These programs are probably not the most efficient ways to generate
  these plots but I don't know much in order to optimise them.
* Most of this code is in the python files and not in Jupyter Notebooks,
  contrary to what GitHub may think.
